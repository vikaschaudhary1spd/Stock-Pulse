          September 01, 2020. 2) Update your e-mail and phone number with your
          stock broker / depository participant and receive OTP directly from
          depository on your e-mail and/or mobile number to create pledge. 3)
          Check your securities / MF / bonds in the consolidated account
          statement issued by NSDL/CDSL every month.

          while dealing in securities markets - once KYC is done through a SEBI
